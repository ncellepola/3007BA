<h1 align="center">🌟 Speech Audio Data Compression Using Machine Learning Dimensionality Reduction 🌟</h1>
<p align="center">Start your project with Single Command</p>

## 🚀 Main files in the project 

You are just one command away to start your next project

- **MFCC.ipynb**

- **PCA.ipynb**

- **Readme.md**

## 🦋 Prerequisite

- [Python](https://www.python.org/ "Python") Installed

- Python Basics Understanding

- Librosa library Installed

- Anaconda


## 🛠️ Description 

1. MFCC

Audio file is converted to a multi-dimensional array using MFCC.Dimensions of the multi-dimensional array are further reduced using PCA. Memory allocation for this compact audio representation is then compared with the original audio file size. However, the sound quality comparison is beyond the scope of this research.  

- Notebook will load the data file using librosa library
- MFCC feautes are created using ** build_estimates ** function 

2. PCA

instead of using MFCC we directly used PCA with padding to convert the audio file

3. Add Environment Variable path of this directory

4. Run the app using terminal

**🎇 You are Ready to Go!**

## ❗ Available Commands

In the project directory, you can run:

```Bash
create
```

Either run this command in the project folder or set the path of `create.bat` in the environmental variable for executing create command anywhere (Run, cmd, or PowerShell).

```Bash
create <project_name>
```

For creating Local Repo use this command and it will create a local repository in the path provided.

```Bash
create <project_name> -g
```

For creating a Global Repo use this command and it will create a global repository on your GitHub profile using `gh` and make & push the initial commit.

```Bash
create <project_name> -o
```

For creating an Organization Repo use this command and it will create an Organization repository on your GitHub profile using `gh` and make & push the initial commit

> If you pass any other option like `-pr` then the repo will be private otherwise it will be public

## 👷 Built with

- [Python](https://www.python.org/ "Python"): as Main Coding Language for executing commands

- [Batch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file "Batch") : For python file executor

- [Github](https://github.com/ "Github") : For Repo Storage and source code management

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/ "Git") : For Version Control System

- [Github CLI](https://cli.github.com/ "Github CLI"): For Direct Interacting with Github

## 📂 Directory Structure

> [`create.bat`](https://github.com/king-technologies/Project-Initiator/blob/main/create.bat "Create Command"): Command file that will execute the python file

> [`remote.py`](https://github.com/king-technologies/Project-Initiator/blob/main/remote.py "Main File"): Python file, the main file that contains the script

## 🎊 Future Updates

- [ ] Add project boilerplate automatically for different languages and frameworks

- [ ] Add GUI

- [x] Add Screenshots Folder

- [x] Add Project to WorkSpaces

- [ ] Add Documentations
